# Employee Prediction Dashboard
The Employee Prediction Dashboard is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the analysis and prediction of employee metrics over time. It provides an interactive interface for comparing historical data with future projections, enabling dynamic adjustment of key parameters and visual feedback on growth trends.

## Features
1. Historical Data Comparison: Display historical data alongside prediction data in a tabular format for easy comparison.
Allow direct editing of all data in the spreadsheet, including historical data, with synchronous updates.

2. Enhanced Input Controls: Align parameters in a transparent grid with text fields on the top row and sliders on the bottom row.
Display both Hiring Rate and Hiring Number inputs simultaneously, ensuring dynamic adjustment in response to changes.
Replace all rate inputs with sliders for better user interaction.
3. Growth Indicator: Highlight positive growth in green and negative growth in red for immediate visual feedback.

## Usage
1. Initialize the Dashboard: Historical data is pre-populated in the table. The predicted data row is automatically updated based on the input parameters.
2. Adjust Parameters: Modify the current total employees, projected hiring rate, projected new hires, and expected turnover rate using either text inputs or sliders.
Changes in one input will dynamically update the other linked inputs (e.g., adjusting the hiring rate will update the hiring number and vice versa).
3. View Predictions: The prediction row displays the projected employee metrics for the next year based on the current inputs. The growth rate is calculated and highlighted in green if positive and red if negative.
